# Class Based Views Implementation

The following project consists of implementation of CBV's. Coming from a functional paradigm of views,
I have found it to be phenomenally easy to use CBV's

I shall soon adopt this methodology to work with Views.

This Project Employs the following 
1.) Python 3.6.5
2.) Django 1.10

I am using an older version of Django because it is in accordance with a tutorial I am 
following online!
